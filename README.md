This project implements ID card detection using a TensorFlow-based object detection model and fingerprint capture using MediaPipe Hands.
This project implements ID card detection using a TensorFlow-based object detection model and fingerprint capture using MediaPipe Hands.

âœ¨ Features:
âœ… ID Card Detection: Uses a pre-trained model to detect ID cards in images, draw bounding boxes, and save results.
âœ… Fingerprint Capture: Guides users to place fingers in a marked area for image capture.
âœ… Real-time Processing: Utilizes OpenCV for live detection via webcam.
âœ… AI-Powered: Leverages TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe for robust performance.
